# Project 1: Car API

# Enterprise CRUD API 

You will create a full-stack API complete with database, backend, and frontend. This API will be centered around some enterprise object of your choice (house, flights, cars, products, movies, etc.). 

Your app must provide a means for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting the objects, and show those changes on the frontend.  

This project will be due by the end of the 5th week, October 22, 2021. 

# Requirements: 

Must contain some method on the frontend for the user to do each of CRUD operations on the enterprise objects being managed. 

The enterprise object must contain at least eight different attributes.  

The frontend must be user friendly. There will be a focus on UI/UX during the presentation.  

Database with MySQL. 

Backend with Java. 

Frontend with HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
