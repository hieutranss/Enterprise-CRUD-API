# Enterprise CRUD API 

Create a full-stack API complete with database, backend, and frontend. This API will be centered around some enterprise object of your choice (house, flights, cars, products, movies, etc.). 

The app must provide a means for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting the objects, and show those changes on the frontend.  


# Requirements: 

Must contain some method on the frontend for the user to do each of CRUD operations on the enterprise objects being managed. 

The enterprise object must contain at least eight different attributes.  

The frontend must be user friendly. There will be a focus on UI/UX during the presentation.  

Database with MySQL. 

Backend with Java. 

Frontend with HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
